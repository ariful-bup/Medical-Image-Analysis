# Medical-Image-Analysis
AI-Powered Adaptive Medical Image Analysis System

This web application for medical image analysis leverages adaptive learning to improve the accuracy and reliability of AI models over time. AI models are often trained on datasets from single sources, such as one hospital, and when deployed on real-world data, they often struggle due to the variability of the data. This system allows users (doctors) to upload images, verify whether the AI’s predictions are correct, and provide feedback if needed. 


Problem Statement
High initial risk in deploying AI models for medical diagnosis: Medical diagnoses are high-stakes process and require physician supervision to avoid errors. Lack of trust in AI systems due to insufficient testing and adaptation in real-world settings.
AI models in medical image analysis face limitations in adapting to evolving data over time.
Medical image analysis faces challenges such as lack of accuracy across different regions, including variations due to racial and geographical differences.

Project Objective
Develop a web application that: Adapts to user feedback to continuously improve the AI model’s performance  that Classifies medical images (e.g., X-rays, MRIs, CT scans)
Builds trust and confidence in AI systems: Ensures that the model is deployed under doctor supervision during initial usage, Collects real-time feedback from medical experts to reduce risks and improve the system, Enables a smooth transition to a reliable AI model for independent use over time.

Key Featureas
Confidence Building in the Medical Domain
Our system ensures doctor supervision during early use cases: Doctors provide real-time feedback on model predictions during clinical workflows, The AI adapts to the feedback, reducing errors and increasing reliability.
Over time, the model becomes sufficiently trained and trustworthy for semi-autonomous or autonomous usage.
This process reduce risks and helps establish trust in AI systems for medical diagnostics.

=> Usecase Scenario
Step 1: A doctor in a hospital uploads an X-ray and receives a prediction of whether a patient has Covid.
Step 2: A user provides feedback indicating the model misclassified the X-ray. The model adapts by retraining on new data.
Step 3: As the system receives more feedback, it becomes more accurate at detecting Covid, even when the dataset shifts (new demographics or hospital imaging scale).
